# Probability

This project covers probability distributions and statistical concepts, focusing on implementing various probability distributions from scratch.

## Learning Objectives

* Understanding probability distributions
* Working with Poisson, Exponential, Normal, and Binomial distributions
* Calculating probability density functions (PDF) and cumulative distribution functions (CDF)
* Understanding statistical concepts like mean, variance, and standard deviation

## Requirements

* Python 3.5+
* numpy
* All files should be executable
* Code should follow pycodestyle (version 2.5)
* All modules, classes, and functions should be documented

## Tasks

### 0. Initialize Poisson

Create a class `Poisson` that represents a Poisson distribution with proper initialization and validation.

**File:** `poisson.py`

## Repository

* **GitHub repository:** holbertonschool-machine_learning
* **Directory:** math/probability

## Author

Project completed as part of Holberton School Machine Learning curriculum.
